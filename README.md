Animotes - An Anime Quote Search App

Welcome to Animotes, a front-end development project where you can search for anime quotes by character name, series name or movie name. This project was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The styling may be a bit outdated, but it represents a great effort to learn and improve coding skills.
Getting Started

To get started with Animotes, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
How to Use

When you open the app, you will see a search bar with three filters: Character, Movie and Series. You can use any of these filters to search for quotes based on your preference. Once you select the filter and enter your search term, click on the Search button to get your results.

When you get your search results, you will see a list of anime quotes that match your search. Each quote will show the name of the anime series, the name of the character who said the quote, and the actual quote.
Future Development

    Add more search filters to make it easier to find quotes based on specific criteria.
    Improve the styling of the app to make it more modern and user-friendly.
    Add a feature to allow users to save their favorite quotes or share them on social media.
    Expand the database to include more quotes from different anime series.
